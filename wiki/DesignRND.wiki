  * [http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2004/tn2123.html TN2123: CrashReporter] - not updated for Leopard.

= CrashReporter on Leopard =

On Leopard, CrashReporter writes individual `.crash` files for each crash.  The files are stored flat in `~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/` and are of the form `AppName_YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss_hostname.crash`.

= CrashReporter on Tiger =

On Tiger, CrashReporter appends each crash to a file `AppName.crash.log` in `~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/` so acquiring the date of the last crash is slightly more of a pain.
